# Accounting Reconciler

---

### Reconcile accounting accounts easily

---

> Using the main program is simple once you've completed the necessary configuration to connect to your database. You just need to extract a table with the transactions from the period you want to analyze, as well as from the immediately preceding or following period. You can also compare and reconcile groups of months if they are related to each other.

(Don't worry, I've also created a separated project to extract these data tables, and it will be released soon! ;))

> Once you have the data tables ready, run the main program. First, select the table that represents the most recent period, then select the oldest one
